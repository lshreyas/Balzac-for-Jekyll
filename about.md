## <center>Data Scientist, Design Geek, Occasional Jedi</<center>

### <center>Pronounced Sh-ray-us Luckh-tuck-ia</center>
I'm an engineer by training and data scientist by trade. I'm interested in technology and policy and passionate about design and data. I currently work as a data scientist at [Flatiron Health](http://www.flatiron.com/) where my team is using [machine learning](https://www.ispor.org/heor-resources/presentations-database/presentation/intl2020-3182/100099) to expand accesss to care. Before this, I was fortunate to work with [Ziad Obermeyer](http://ziadobermeyer.com/) and [Sendhil Mullainathan](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/faculty/directory/m/sendhil-mullainathan) 
in the [Systems Medicine Lab](http://www.labsysmed.org), where we trod a fine line between think-tank and startup. 

I've lived in India, Germany and the American Northeast and am most in an oxford button-down in hipster caf√©s everywhere.
I enjoy playing squash and chess, and in a previous life, played table-tennis professionally. I'm a certified scuba diver, and have dived in the Bay of Thailand, the Indian Ocean and the Andaman Sea, a list I hope to soon expand. I can butcher as many as 5 languages - and see 2 golden retrievers in my future.
