**<center>Pronounced Sh-ray-us Luckh-tuck-ia</center>**

I'm interested in technology and policy and my work has focussed on using data to [improve society](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/366/6464/447) and [healthcare](https://www.nber.org/papers/w26168.pdf). I'm currently a data scientist at [Flatiron Health](http://www.flatiron.com/) where my team is using [machine learning](https://www.ispor.org/heor-resources/presentations-database/presentation/intl2020-3182/100099) to expand accesss to care. Before this, I was fortunate to work with [Ziad Obermeyer](http://ziadobermeyer.com/) and [Sendhil Mullainathan](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/faculty/directory/m/sendhil-mullainathan) in the [Systems Medicine Lab](http://www.labsysmed.org), where we trod a fine line between think-tank and startup.<br> <br>
I've lived in India, Germany and the US, and am most at-home in the neighborhood hipster caf√© (preferably clad in a white oxford shirt). I enjoy playing squash and chess, and am a certified scuba diver. I can butcher as many as 5 languages - and see 2 golden retrievers in my future. In the mean time, I'm biding my time as a volunteer at [PAWS in New York](https://pawsny.org/).
