**<center>Pronounced Sh-ray-us Luckh-tuck-ia</center>**

I'm interested in technology and policy and my work has focussed on using machine learning to improve society and healthcare. I'm currently a data scientist at [Flatiron Health](http://www.flatiron.com/) where my team is using [machine learning](https://www.ispor.org/heor-resources/presentations-database/presentation/intl2020-3182/100099) to expand accesss to care. Before this, I was fortunate to work with [Ziad Obermeyer](http://ziadobermeyer.com/) and [Sendhil Mullainathan](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/faculty/directory/m/sendhil-mullainathan) in the [Systems Medicine Lab](http://www.labsysmed.org), where we trod a fine line between think-tank and startup.<br>
I've lived in India, Germany and the US, and am most at-home in the neighborhood hipster caf√© (preferably clad in a white oxford shirt). I enjoy playing squash and chess, and am a certified scuba diver. I can butcher as many as 5 languages - and see 2 golden retrievers in my future.
