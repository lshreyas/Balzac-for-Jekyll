## <center>Data Scientist, Design Geek, & Occasional Jedi</center>

### Bio
I'm an engineer by training and data scientist by trade. I'm interested in technology and policy and passionate about design and data. I currently work as a data scientist at [Flatiron Health](http://www.flatiron.com/) where my team is using [machine learning](https://www.ispor.org/heor-resources/presentations-database/presentation/intl2020-3182/100099) to expand accesss to care. Before this, I was fortunate to work with [Ziad Obermeyer](http://ziadobermeyer.com/) and [Sendhil Mullainathan](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/faculty/directory/m/sendhil-mullainathan) 
in the [Systems Medicine Lab](http://www.labsysmed.org), where we trod a fine line between think-tank and startup. 

<!-- I'm really passionate about beautiful products that make a difference. Among other things, I've programmed a robot, engineered an autonomous semi-intelligent car, and as of this morning, successfully cooked an edible breakfast.

### Experiences
The breadth of my past work -- 

* from setting up a robotic roller coaster at the [Robotics Lab](https://www.uni-due.de/mechanikb/forschung/projekte.php) at the University of Duisburg, 
* to setting up student computers at the [Princeton University](http://www.princeton.edu) Office of IT, 
* to working as a management consultant at the [Boston Consulting Group](https://www.bcg.com/)

-- has taken me from America to Asia and Europe, given me a range of perspectives and most importantly an incredibly diverse worldview. -->

I enjoy playing squash and chess, and in a previous life, played table-tennis professionally. I'm a certified scuba diver, and have dived in the Bay of Thailand, the Indian Ocean and the Andaman Sea, a list I hope to soon expand. I can butcher as many as 5 languages - and see 2 golden retrievers in my future.
