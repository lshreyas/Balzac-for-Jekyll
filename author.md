## <center>Data Scientist, Design Geek, & Occasional Jedi</center>

### Bio
I'm an engineer by training and data scientist by trade. I'm interested in policy and management, with a passion for technology and data. I currently work as a data scientist in the [Systems Medicine Lab](http://www.labsysmed.org) at the [Harvard Medical School](http://www.hms.harvard.edu), where we're treading a fine line between a startup and a research lab. I'm really passionate about beautiful products that make a difference. Among other things, I've programmed a robot, engineered an autonomous semi-intelligent car, and as of this morning, successfully cooked an edible breakfast.

### Experiences
The breadth of my work -- 

* from setting up a robotic roller coaster at the [Robotics Lab](https://www.uni-due.de/mechanikb/forschung/projekte.php) at the University of Duisburg, 
* to setting up student computers at the [Princeton University](http://www.princeton.edu) Office of IT, 
* to working as a management consultant at the [Boston Consulting Group](https://www.bcg.com/)

-- has taken me from America to Asia and Europe, given me a range of perspectives and most importantly an incredibly diverse worldview.

I enjoy playing squash and chess, and in a previous life, played table-tennis professionally. I'm a certified scuba diver, and have dived in the Bay of Thailand, the Indian Ocean and the Andaman Sea, a list I hope to soon expand. I speak 5 languages - and see two golden retrievers in my future.
